    "\n",

    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The CNN-based encoder has a pre-trained ResNet-50 deep neural network as a head except for its final output layer, followed by a Linear layer to embed the output from the second to last (penultimate) layer of a ResNet-50 network to a tensor of length `embed_size`. The head layers from ResNet-50 of the encoder are all freezed so their weights won't be trained during training. Only the weights of the Linear layer will be trained to learn a good embedding from the output from the penultimate layer of a ResNet-50 network to a tensor of length `embed_size`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RNN-based decoder consists of an Embedding layer to convert the integer indices of words in the vocabulary of size `vocab_size` to an embedded space of dimension `embed_size`. Then an LSTM layer follows. Note that `batch_first` parameter is set to `True`, so the input and output tensors of such layer are provided as `(batch, seq_len, input_size)`. Then the output of the LSTM layer is fed into a Linear layer and transformed to a tensor whose last dimension is of size `vocab_size` so the cross entropy loss can be employed to refer the true results in the vocabulary set of size `vocab_size`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are my selection of the values of the variables in Task 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "batch_size = 64          # batch size\n",
    "vocab_threshold = 4        # minimum word count threshold\n",
    "vocab_from_file = False    # if True, load existing vocab file\n",
    "embed_size = 256           # dimensionality of image and word embeddings\n",
    "hidden_size = 512          # number of features in hidden state of the RNN decoder\n",
    "num_epochs = 3             # number of training epochs\n",
    "save_every = 1             # determines frequency of saving model weights\n",
    "print_every = 100          # determines window for printing average loss\n",
    "log_file = 'training_log.txt'       # name of file with saved training loss and perplexity\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `transform_train` is defined as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "transform_train = transforms.Compose([ \n",
    "    transforms.Resize(256),                          # smaller edge of image resized to 256\n",
    "    transforms.RandomCrop(224),                      # get 224x224 crop from random location\n",
    "    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),               # horizontally flip image with probability=0.5\n",
    "    transforms.ToTensor(),                           # convert the PIL Image to a tensor\n",
    "    transforms.Normalize((0.485, 0.456, 0.406),      # normalize image for pre-trained model\n",
    "                         (0.229, 0.224, 0.225))])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Such transform can normalize the size, add randomness, and normalize the pixel values of input image tensors, and hence could lead to a robust and generalizable trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoder is built from scratch so all of its weights need to be trained. The encoder, however, has a pre-trained ResNet-50 deep neural network (constructed by passing `pretrained=True`) as a head except for its final output layer, followed by a Linear layer to embed the output from the second to last (penultimate) layer of a ResNet-50 network to a tensor of length `embed_size`. Since the ResNet-50 network has been pre-trained, its head layers can be all freezed so their weights won't be trained during training. Only the weights of the Linear layer will be trained to learn a good embedding from the output from the penultimate layer of a ResNet-50 network to a tensor of length `embed_size`. Therefore,\n",

    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "is a good choice for learnable parameters.\n",

    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose an Adam optimizer with learning rate of `1e-3`: `optim.Adam(params, lr=1e-3)`."

    "```python\n",
    "# Load pre-trained weights before resuming training.\n",
    "encoder.load_state_dict(torch.load(os.path.join('./models', encoder_file)))\n",
    "decoder.load_state_dict(torch.load(os.path.join('./models', decoder_file)))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While trying out parameters, make sure to take extensive notes and record the settings that you used in your various training runs.  In particular, you don't want to encounter a situation where you've trained a model for several hours but can't remember what settings you used :).\n",

    "### A Note on Tuning Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "To figure out how well your model is doing, you can look at how the training loss and perplexity evolve during training - and for the purposes of this project, you are encouraged to amend the hyperparameters based on this information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this will not tell you if your model is overfitting to the training data, and, unfortunately, overfitting is a problem that is commonly encountered when training image captioning models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you need not worry about overfitting. **This project does not have strict requirements regarding the performance of your model**, and you just need to demonstrate that your model has learned **_something_** when you generate captions on the test data.  For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, if you would like to go above and beyond in this project, you can read about some approaches to minimizing overfitting in section 4.3.1 of [this paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7505636).  In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
